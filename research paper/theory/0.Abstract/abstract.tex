%Why this project
Automatic generation of models may lead to the key of understanding and verifying real life systems. 
%
Automata learning is a very powerful approach for this manner, that consists of inferring models from observations. 
%
However, systems are becoming more complex and consequently difficult to learn and infer in practice. 
%
In this paper, we introduce a method of learning and measuring observations of probabilistic timed automata incrementally, by assigning and evaluating costs of the similarities of observations, to model behaviors of non-deterministic systems.
%
In the experiments conducted, we demonstrate how the level of abstraction of an inferred model can drastically vary depending on the different cost parameters applied, and also how this may impact the learning process itself.
%
The utilization of cost functions in automata learning is used as a technique to reduce the complexity of learning systems, and also proposed for other potential areas of application like automata minimization.
